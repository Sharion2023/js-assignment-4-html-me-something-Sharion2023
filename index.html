         <h2> Where I thought I'd be as an adult:</h2>
         <p>
            If you had asked me fresh out of high school what I'd be doing with my life in 20 years, I'd have told you a much different <br>
            story than what I'm actually living today. I was always great at math and I loved physics, so engineering was supposedly my
            destiny. It took me a lot of classes and an internship to figure out that I just wasn't cut out for a cubicle! So, I ended
            that dream with an Associates's of Applied Science degree in Engineering. I pivoted and obtained an Associate's of Applied
            Science degreen in Respiratory Care. And little did I know, that was just the beginning of how differently things would shape
            up.
