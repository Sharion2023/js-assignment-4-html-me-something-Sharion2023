      <h1>My Favorite Vacation Spots</h1>

      <p>I have been blessed to visit many amazing places in my 41 years of life. And I'd be hard pressed to pick just ONE favorite.
         So, I've chosed to share my favorites as they fit into three categories: My favorite beach vacation, my favorite non-beach vacation,
         and my favorite family vacation.

         <h2> My Favorite Beach Vacation:</h2>
         <p>
            Up until very recently, my favorite spot would have been Oahu, HI! I went on a trip with my school as a senior in high school, and
            I loved it. The mountains, the beaches, the water...all so beautiful. I've tried to duplicate that experience and get back ever
            since. However, things didn't work out for my husband's and my 20th wedding anniversary. So, we chose St. John in the US Virgin
            Islands. And <b>that's</b> now hands down my favorite spot. It was such a rich mix of culture, beaches, adventure and delicious foods
            that I'd recommend it to anyone. You can absolutely have a great time whether you're the relaxing type, the adventurous type, or 
            somewhere in between.

            We went to St. John for 6 nights and stayed at a place that was more bed and breakfast than hotel. It was perfect! The hosts were very
            knowledgable of the island and helpful to our planning. We spent our days exploring the many beaches around the island and snorkeling
            to appreciate the coral and sea life! This island was a completely unique experience for us because, from the moment you step foot 
            onto the island itself, you don't see <em>any</em> commercial stores or chain restaurants. Pretty much every place you shop, from 
            what we experienced, was local to St. John or the USVI. The atmosphere is very relaxed. The lion's share of the business is done on 
            the port side of the island. Some locals live around other parts, but 2/3 of the entire island is national park property! So, there'
            lots to explore.         </p>
