      <p>Once upon a time, 23 years ago, I was a fresh high school grad. As far as everyone was concerned, 
         I was destined to be an engineer one day. I had no objections and set about my merry way! Here's the story of how
         two decades, two college degrees and seven kids later I'm attempting to find my way to what I actually wanted to do all along.

         When I started my academic career at Rockhurst University, I was all in to major in civil engineering (which eventually meant 
         a transfer). After all I loved physics and math. So, why not?!? Well, turns out the why not is that it bored me to tears. Too
         bad it took me a long time to admit that. LOL!! Anyway, there I was going through so many diffucult classes and transferring schools
         to be an engineer. By the time I had completed my freshman year, I was set with a sweet summer intership at an amazing local firm.
         The work was not my cup of tea, but the coworkers were great and the pay was premium. All I needed to do was muddle through and 
         graduate. I managed to carry on for another year or so before it became more clear that this wasn't for me.

         The summer following my sophomore year, I took a C++ programming class. And, boy, was I in my element!!! I liked it so much that
         I went to the advisor's office and changed my major to computer programming. Blah, blah, blah!
