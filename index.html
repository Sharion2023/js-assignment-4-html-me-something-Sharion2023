      <h1>My Favorite Vacation Spots</h1>

      <p>I have been blessed to visit many amazing places in my 41 years of life. And I'd be hard pressed to pick just ONE favorite.
         So, I've chosed to share my favorites as they fit into three categories: My favorite beach vacation, my favorite non-beach vacation,
         and my favorite family vacation.
      </p>

         <h2> My Favorite Beach Vacation:</h2>
         <p>
            Up until very recently, my favorite spot would have been Oahu, HI! I went on a trip with my school as a senior in high school, and
            I loved it. The mountains, the beaches, the water...all so beautiful. I've tried to duplicate that experience and get back ever
            since. However, things didn't work out for my husband's and my 20th wedding anniversary. So, we chose St. John in the US Virgin
            Islands. And <b>that's</b> now hands down my favorite spot. It was such a rich mix of culture, beaches, adventure and delicious foods
            that I'd recommend it to anyone. You can absolutely have a great time whether you're the relaxing type, the adventurous type, or 
            somewhere in between.</p>

            <p>We went to St. John for 6 nights and stayed at a place that was more bed and breakfast than hotel. It was perfect! The hosts were very
            knowledgable of the island and helpful to our planning. We spent our days exploring the many beaches around the island and snorkeling
            to appreciate the coral and sea life! This island was a completely unique experience for us because, from the moment you step foot 
            onto the island itself, you don't see <em>any</em> commercial stores or chain restaurants. Pretty much every place you shop, from 
            what we experienced, was local to St. John or the USVI. The atmosphere is very relaxed. The lion's share of the business is done on 
            the port side of the island and it's pretty easily walkable. Some locals live around other parts, but 2/3 of the entire island is 
            national park property! So, there' lots to explore. The fact that St. John is an island makes everything more expensive because most things have to be imported. It als
            lends itself fewer education and job opportunities for locals. We chatted with anyone who was willing about real life on the island.
            The only way around the island is by "taxi" unless you rent a car. These taxis are not what we'd probably tradiionaly consider.
            They are basically trucks (Ford F350's or so) outfitted with multiple benches to seat approximately 15-17 passengers. Those were some
            harrowing rides. LOL!! We were able to do hikes and historical tours, in addition to our beach trips. We went, we saw, I hate possibly
            the best shrimp tacos I'll have in my entire life!</p>

         <h2>My Favorite Non-Beach Vacation:</h2>
         <p>
            My favorite non-beach vacation hasn't changed in the 17 years since I first visited Alaska! There's absolutely nothing like it!
            There is something amazing and stunning about the compltely untouched nature of the Alaskan wilderness. We spent the bulk of our
            time in Fairbanks, but we also had the opportunity to camp inside Denali Park. Despite the fact that there are plenty of talks
            about how to NOT get eaten by a bear, I'd go back over and over again without hesitation. LOL!!! Besides hiking mountains, we also
            had the opportunity to cruise and see glaciers, as well as walking over some frozen tundra. We visited in June, so getting used to
            knowing it was bedtime while it was still <em>very</em> daylight-looking outside was tricky! Our family was able to return, with 6
            of our kids in tow, for a family reunion about 6 years ago. It was just as magical as I remembered it!

         <h2> My Favorite Family Vacation:</h2>
         <p>
            If I'm taking Alaska out of the running, my favorite family is vacation is one that we just returned from. It was a trek from
            Kansas City to Yellowstone National Park. It was LONG and some parts seemed like all of the kids might not make it through, but it 
            was ultimately wonderful! We had several stops in Nebraska and South Dakota on the way out and back, so we saw plenty outside of
            the national park itself. Partway through the journey out, we linked up wit my best friend and her family to travel the rest of the way.
            
         </p>
         <p> When we finally made it to Yellowstone, we made sure to do the typical tourist stuff. We visted Old Faithful and made sure to catch
            an eruption. We also went around to see more nearby gysers and hot springs. While we were there, we had a couple of close encounters
            with bison (but <em>not</em> too close!).One of the most fascinating things I saw was the full skeleton of a bison next to a geyser.
            My assumption is that it was the casualty of an eruption. So, any thoughts of messing with bison or geysers is pure foolishness!
